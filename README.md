# MonoTK Overview
This is a test project in attempt to create a cross-platform solution to the Monogame Toolkit test project currently in C#. 
The purpose of this project is to test whether the OpenGL rendering and user interface are suitable to meet the requirements set out for Monogame Toolkit.

## Project Plan
This is a list of the following items this test project needs to demonstrate in order to be promoted to a "real" project.

* Demonstrate that OpenGL rendering is easy to do and isn't cumbersome with Qt.
* Demonstrate that we can render advanced OpenGL with Qt.
* Demonstrate that the Qt Framework's ease of use will allow us to satisfy all the project's requirements in a timely manner.
* Provide a framework that is less error-prone (c++ memory issues) than we would otherwise have in the C# environment.
* Demonstrate a cross-platform solution to MonoTK, giving all developers the ability to use this system.

The following task list displays a timeline of the items that we plan to implement in the toolkit.
